- Compare to healthy examples
- Identify contamination types
- Assess growth patterns

**Step 3: Root Cause Analysis**
- Environmental factors (temp, humidity, FAE)
- Contamination sources
- Technique issues
- Substrate problems
- Genetics/spawn quality

**Step 4: Solution Implementation**
- Immediate actions (isolate, dispose, adjust)
- Long-term fixes (improve technique, optimize conditions)
- Prevention strategies

### 2. COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

#### CONTAMINATION ISSUES

**Green Mold (Trichoderma)**
- **Symptoms**: Bright green powdery growth, spreads rapidly
- **Causes**: Poor sterile technique, contaminated spawn, dirty environment
- **Solutions**:
  1. Immediately isolate contaminated containers
  2. Dispose safely (bury or trash, don't open indoors)
  3. Deep clean grow area with bleach/70% alcohol
  4. Improve sterile technique (SAB, flow hood, better practices)
  5. Use fresh spawn, check spawn quality
- **Prevention**: Better sterile technique, clean environment, quality spawn

**Black Mold (Aspergillus)**
- **Symptoms**: Black powdery spores, musty smell
- **Causes**: High humidity, poor air circulation, contaminated substrate
- **Solutions**:
  1. Dispose immediately (health hazard)
  2. Improve air circulation
  3. Lower humidity if too high
  4. Check substrate quality
- **Prevention**: Better FAE, proper humidity, quality substrate

**Bacterial Contamination**
- **Symptoms**: Slimy, wet appearance, sour smell, orange/yellow slime
- **Causes**: Over-hydration, poor drainage, contaminated water
- **Solutions**:
  1. Remove contaminated areas if possible
  2. Improve drainage
  3. Reduce moisture
  4. Check water source quality
- **Prevention**: Proper field capacity, good drainage, clean water

**Cobweb Mold**
- **Symptoms**: Gray fuzzy growth, spreads quickly
- **Causes**: High humidity, poor FAE, contaminated spawn
- **Solutions**:
  1. Increase FAE immediately
  2. Lower humidity slightly
  3. Isolate affected containers
  4. Hydrogen peroxide can help (3% solution)
- **Prevention**: Better FAE, proper humidity, quality spawn

#### GROWTH PROBLEMS

**Slow or No Colonization**
- **Symptoms**: Mycelium not spreading, or spreading very slowly
- **Causes**: 
  - Temperature too low/high
  - Insufficient spawn
  - Poor spawn quality
  - Contamination (hidden)
  - Substrate too dry/wet
- **Solutions**:
  1. Check temperature (should be 70-80°F for most species)
  2. Increase spawn ratio (aim for 1:4 to 1:2)
  3. Verify spawn quality (should be fully colonized, no contamination)
  4. Check substrate field capacity (should be moist but not wet)
  5. Be patient (some species are slow)
- **Prevention**: Optimal conditions, quality spawn, proper ratios

**No Pinning/Fruiting**
- **Symptoms**: Fully colonized but no mushrooms forming
- **Causes**:
  - Wrong environmental conditions
  - Over-colonization (overlay)
  - Insufficient fresh air
  - Wrong temperature
  - Insufficient light
  - Genetics
- **Solutions**:
  1. Introduce fruiting conditions (lower temp, increase humidity, add FAE)
  2. Scratch surface if overlay present (fork tek)
  3. Increase fresh air exchange
  4. Add indirect light (12 hours/day)
  5. Check species-specific requirements
  6. Be patient (some species take weeks)
- **Prevention**: Proper fruiting conditions, good FAE, species-appropriate setup

**Small or Deformed Fruits**
- **Symptoms**: Mushrooms are small, misshapen, or have long stems
- **Causes**:
  - Insufficient FAE (CO2 buildup)
  - Low humidity
  - Insufficient nutrients
  - Genetics
  - Overcrowding
- **Solutions**:
  1. Increase fresh air exchange (fanning, automated system)
  2. Increase humidity (85-95% for most species)
  3. Improve substrate nutrition (supplementation)
  4. Reduce spawn density if overcrowded
  5. Consider genetics (try different strain)
- **Prevention**: Optimal FAE, proper humidity, quality substrate

**Aborts (Stopped Growing)**
- **Symptoms**: Small pins that stop growing, turn dark
- **Causes**:
  - Environmental stress (temp/humidity fluctuations)
  - Contamination
  - Insufficient nutrients
  - Genetics
- **Solutions**:
  1. Stabilize environmental conditions
  2. Check for contamination
  3. Improve substrate quality
  4. Harvest aborts (still usable)
  5. Improve conditions for next flush
- **Prevention**: Stable conditions, quality substrate, good genetics

**Overlay (Thick Mycelium Mat)**
- **Symptoms**: Thick, dense mycelium layer, no pinning
- **Causes**:
  - Too much CO2
  - Insufficient FAE
  - Over-colonization
- **Solutions**:
  1. Increase fresh air exchange dramatically
  2. Scratch surface (fork tek) to break overlay
  3. Add casing layer if appropriate
  4. Lower CO2 levels
- **Prevention**: Proper FAE from start, don't over-colonize

#### ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

**Temperature Problems**
- **Too Hot**: Slow growth, contamination risk, stress
  - Solution: Lower to optimal range (70-80°F colonization, 60-75°F fruiting)
  - Methods: Air conditioning, move to cooler location, insulation
- **Too Cold**: Very slow growth, no fruiting
  - Solution: Increase to optimal range
  - Methods: Heating pad, space heater, insulation
- **Fluctuations**: Stress, slow growth, contamination risk
  - Solution: Stabilize temperature
  - Methods: Thermostat, insulation, consistent location

**Humidity Problems**
- **Too Low**: Dry substrate, no pinning, small fruits
  - Solution: Increase to 85-95% for fruiting
  - Methods: Misting, humidifier, Martha tent, perlite layer
- **Too High**: Contamination risk, poor FAE, bacterial issues
  - Solution: Lower to appropriate range, improve FAE
  - Methods: Dehumidifier, better ventilation, reduce misting

**FAE Problems**
- **Insufficient**: Long stems, small caps, fuzzy feet, no pinning
  - Solution: Dramatically increase fresh air exchange
  - Methods: Fanning (3-4x daily), automated fan, filtered air system
- **Too Much**: Dry substrate, low humidity, slow growth
  - Solution: Balance FAE with humidity
  - Methods: Reduce fanning frequency, use humidifier, cover more

### 3. DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

**For Contamination:**
1. What color is the contamination?
2. What texture (powdery, slimy, fuzzy)?
3. Where did it start (surface, sides, injection point)?
4. How fast is it spreading?
5. What does it smell like?

**For Growth Issues:**
1. What growth stage are you at?
2. How long has it been since inoculation/colonization?
3. What are your current temps/humidity?
4. What's your spawn ratio?
5. What species/strain?

**For Fruiting Issues:**
1. Is the substrate fully colonized?
2. How long since introducing fruiting conditions?
3. What are your fruiting temps/humidity?
4. How much fresh air exchange?
5. Is there indirect light?
