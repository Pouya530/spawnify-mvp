### 2. CULTIVATION METHODS

**PF Tek (Psilocybe Fanaticus Technique)**
- Best for: Beginners, small-scale grows
- Substrate: Brown rice flour + vermiculite
- Inoculation: Spore syringe
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks total
- Yield: 10-30g dry per jar
- Pros: Simple, low contamination risk, educational
- Cons: Low yield, labor intensive

**Monotub**
- Best for: Intermediate growers, larger yields
- Substrate: Coco coir + vermiculite + gypsum (CVG)
- Inoculation: Grain spawn
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks colonization + 7-14 days fruiting
- Yield: 100-500g+ dry per tub
- Pros: High yield, efficient, scalable
- Cons: Requires sterile technique, more setup

**Bucket Tek (Oyster Mushrooms)**
- Best for: Oyster mushrooms, beginners
- Substrate: Pasteurized straw or sawdust
- Inoculation: Grain spawn
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks colonization + 5-7 days fruiting
- Yield: 1-3 lbs fresh per flush
- Pros: Simple, low-tech, great for oysters
- Cons: Limited to certain species

**Agar Work**
- Best for: Advanced growers, genetics
- Purpose: Isolation, cloning, contamination identification
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks per transfer
- Pros: Genetic control, contamination management
- Cons: Requires sterile lab technique

**Liquid Culture**
- Best for: Scaling, efficiency
- Purpose: Rapid inoculation, storage
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks colonization
- Pros: Fast inoculation, scalable
- Cons: Requires sterile technique, contamination risk

### 3. TROUBLESHOOTING EXPERTISE

**Contamination Identification**
- Green mold (Trichoderma): Most common, spreads fast
- Black mold (Aspergillus): Dangerous, dispose immediately
- Orange/yellow slime: Bacterial contamination
- Cobweb mold: Gray fuzzy growth
- Black pin mold: Small black dots

**Common Issues**
- Slow colonization: Temperature too low, insufficient spawn
- No fruiting: Wrong conditions, contamination, genetics
- Small fruits: Low humidity, poor FAE, insufficient nutrients
- Aborts: Environmental stress, contamination, genetics
- Overlay: Too much CO2, insufficient FAE

**Solutions**
- Contamination: Isolate, dispose, improve sterile technique
- Slow growth: Check temperature, increase spawn ratio
- No pins: Adjust humidity, FAE, light, temperature
- Low yield: Optimize substrate, spawn ratio, conditions

### 4. ENVIRONMENTAL OPTIMIZATION

**Temperature Ranges**
- Colonization: Generally 70-80°F (species dependent)
- Fruiting: Generally 60-75°F (species dependent)
- Cold fruiting: 45-55°F (Enoki, some oysters)

**Humidity Management**
- Colonization: 70-80% (lower prevents contamination)
- Fruiting: 85-95% (species dependent)
- Methods: Misting, humidifiers, Martha tents

**Fresh Air Exchange (FAE)**
- Critical for: Lion's Mane, Reishi, most species
- Signs of insufficient: Long stems, small caps, fuzzy feet
- Methods: Fanning, automated systems, filtered air

**Light Requirements**
- Most species: Indirect light, 12 hours/day
- Not needed for: Colonization phase
- Types: LED, fluorescent, natural (indirect)

### 5. SUBSTRATE EXPERTISE

**Coco Coir**
- Best for: Monotubs, bulk grows
- Preparation: Pasteurization (160-180°F for 1-2 hours)
- Pros: Clean, consistent, good water retention
- Cons: Low nutrients, needs supplementation

**Straw**
- Best for: Oyster mushrooms
- Preparation: Pasteurization (160-180°F for 1-2 hours)
- Pros: Cheap, readily available
- Cons: Can be contaminated, needs chopping

**Hardwood Sawdust**
- Best for: Wood-loving species (Shiitake, Reishi, Lion's Mane)
- Preparation: Supplementation with bran, sterilization
- Pros: Natural substrate, good yields
- Cons: Requires pressure cooker, supplementation needed

**Manure-Based**
- Best for: Button mushrooms, some gourmet
- Preparation: Composting, pasteurization
- Pros: High nutrients, natural
- Cons: Contamination risk, odor
