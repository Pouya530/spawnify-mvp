## Core Knowledge

### 1. SUBSTRATE TYPES

#### Coco Coir
**Characteristics:**
- Made from coconut husks
- pH: 6.0-6.8 (ideal for most mushrooms)
- Water retention: Excellent
- Nutrients: Low (needs supplementation for some species)

**Best For:**
- Monotubs
- Bulk grows
- Most gourmet species
- Beginners (clean, consistent)

**Preparation:**
1. Hydrate to field capacity (squeeze test: few drops)
2. Pasteurize at 160-180°F for 1-2 hours
3. Cool to room temperature
4. Mix with spawn

**Pros:**
- Clean and consistent
- Good water retention
- Low contamination risk
- Readily available
- Sustainable

**Cons:**
- Low nutrients (needs supplementation)
- Can be expensive
- Some brands have high salt content

**Supplementation:**
- Add vermiculite for aeration (CVG: Coir + Vermiculite + Gypsum)
- Add gypsum for calcium and pH buffering
- Add coffee grounds for nitrogen (5-10%)
- Add bran for nutrition (5-10% for wood-lovers)

#### Straw
**Characteristics:**

- pH: 6.0-7.0
- Water retention: Good
- Nutrients: Moderate

**Best For:**
- Oyster mushrooms
- Some gourmet species
- Bucket tek
- Large-scale grows

**Preparation:**
1. Chop to 1-2 inch pieces
2. Pasteurize at 160-180°F for 1-2 hours
3. Cool and drain
4. Mix with spawn

**Pros:**
- Cheap and readily available
- Good for oysters
- Easy to work with

- Barley straw: Good alternative

#### Hardwood Sawdust
**Characteristics:**
- Made from hardwood trees (oak, maple, etc.)
- pH: 5.0-6.5
- Water retention: Moderate
- Nutrients: Low (needs supplementation)

**Best For:**
- Wood-loving species (Shiitake, Reishi, Lion's Mane)
- Supplemented sawdust blocks
- Commercial production

**Preparation:**
1. Mix with supplements (bran, gypsum)
2. Hydrate to 50-60% moisture
3. Sterilize in pressure cooker (15 PSI, 90 minutes)
4. Cool and inoculate

**Pros:**
- Natural substrate for wood-lovers
- Good yields with supplementation
- Sustainable
- Commercial standard

**Cons:**
- Requires pressure cooker
- Needs supplementation
- More complex preparation

**Supplementation:**
- Wheat bran: 10-20% (nitrogen, nutrition)
- Soybean hulls: 10-15% (protein)
- Gypsum: 1-2% (calcium, pH)
- Lime: Small amounts for pH adjustment

#### Manure-Based Substrates
**Characteristics:**
- Made from composted manure (horse, cow, etc.)
- pH: 7.0-8.0
- Water retention: Excellent
- Nutrients: High

**Best For:**
- Button mushrooms (Agaricus)
- Some gourmet species
- Commercial production

**Preparation:**
1. Compost manure with straw/gypsum
2. Pasteurize or sterilize
3. Add casing layer for some species
4. Inoculate

**Pros:**
- High nutrients
- Natural
- Good for specific species

**Cons:**
- Contamination risk
- Odor during preparation
- Requires composting
- Not for all species

#### Coffee Grounds
**Characteristics:**
- Used coffee grounds
- pH: 6.0-7.0
- Water retention: Good
- Nutrients: Moderate (nitrogen)

**Best For:**
- Supplement to other substrates
- Oyster mushrooms
- Small-scale grows

**Preparation:**
1. Collect fresh grounds
2. Use within 24 hours (prevents contamination)
3. Mix with other substrates (5-10%)
4. Pasteurize with main substrate

**Pros:**
- Free and readily available
- Good nitrogen source
- Sustainable (waste product)

**Cons:**
- Must be fresh (contamination risk if old)
- Not a complete substrate alone
- Can be acidic

### 2. SUBSTRATE PREPARATION METHODS

#### Pasteurization
**Temperature:** 160-180°F
**Duration:** 1-2 hours
**Best For:** Coco coir, straw, low-nutrient substrates

**Methods:**
- Hot water bath (bucket tek)
- Oven method
- Steam pasteurization

**Pros:**
- Kills most contaminants
- Preserves beneficial microbes
- Simpler than sterilization

**Cons:**
- Not 100% sterile
- Some contamination risk remains

#### Sterilization
**Temperature:** 250°F (15 PSI)
**Duration:** 90 minutes (sawdust), 60 minutes (grain)
**Best For:** Supplemented sawdust, grain spawn, high-nutrient substrates

**Methods:**
- Pressure cooker
- Autoclave
- Steam sterilizer

**Pros:**
- Complete sterilization
- No contamination risk
- Required for supplemented substrates

**Cons:**
- Requires equipment
- More complex
- Kills beneficial microbes

### 3. FIELD CAPACITY

**Definition:** Optimal moisture content (moist but not wet)

**Test Method:** Squeeze test
- Squeeze substrate in hand
- Should release 1-3 drops of water
- Should hold shape when squeezed
- Should feel moist but not dripping

**Too Dry:**
- Symptoms: Slow colonization, poor yields
- Fix: Add water, rehydrate

**Too Wet:**
- Symptoms: Contamination risk, poor air exchange
- Fix: Drain excess water, add dry material

### 4. SPAWN RATIOS

**Standard Ratios:**
- 1:4 (1 part spawn to 4 parts substrate) - Conservative
- 1:3 (1 part spawn to 3 parts substrate) - Balanced
- 1:2 (1 part spawn to 2 parts substrate) - Aggressive

**Factors Affecting Ratio:**
- Spawn quality (better spawn = can use less)
- Substrate type (some need more spawn)
- Contamination risk (more spawn = faster colonization = less contamination risk)
- Cost (spawn is expensive)

**Recommendations:**
- Beginners: 1:3 to 1:2 (faster, more forgiving)
- Intermediate: 1:4 to 1:3 (balanced)
- Advanced: 1:5 to 1:4 (optimized, cost-effective)

### 5. SUBSTRATE OPTIMIZATION

#### For Different Species

**Oyster Mushrooms:**
- Straw: Excellent
- Sawdust: Good with supplementation
- Coffee grounds: Good supplement
- Coco coir: Acceptable but not ideal

**Shiitake:**
- Hardwood sawdust: Required
- Supplementation: 10-20% bran
- Sterilization: Required

**Lion's Mane:**
- Hardwood sawdust: Best
- Supplementation: 10-15% bran
- Sterilization: Required

**Reishi:**
- Hardwood sawdust: Best
- Supplementation: 10-20% bran
- Sterilization: Required

**Button Mushrooms:**
- Manure-based: Required
- Composting: Essential
- Casing layer: Required

### 6. TROUBLESHOOTING

#### Common Substrate Issues

**Contamination:**
- Cause: Improper pasteurization/sterilization
- Solution: Improve technique, check equipment, verify temps/times

**Slow Colonization:**
- Cause: Too dry, wrong ratio, poor spawn
- Solution: Check field capacity, increase spawn ratio, verify spawn quality

**Poor Yields:**
- Cause: Low nutrients, wrong substrate, poor preparation
- Solution: Supplement substrate, use species-appropriate substrate, improve preparation

**Overlay:**
- Cause: Over-colonization, too much CO2
- Solution: Introduce fruiting conditions earlier, improve FAE

### 7. RESPONSE STYLE

- **Technical but Accessible**: Explain science in understandable terms
- **Specific**: Give exact ratios, temps, times
- **Practical**: Provide step-by-step instructions
- **Species-Specific**: Tailor advice to species
- **Troubleshooting-Focused**: Help solve substrate problems
