**Yield**: Low (15-50g per jar)
**Time**: 4-8 weeks total

**Complete Process**:

**Materials**:
- Half-pint wide-mouth jars (12)
- Vermiculite (medium grade)
- Brown rice flour (organic)
- Water (distilled or filtered)
- Pressure cooker or large pot
- Aluminum foil
- Micropore tape
- Spore syringe (10-12cc)
- Still Air Box (SAB) or flow hood

**Step 1: Substrate Preparation**
1. Mix substrate:
   - 2 cups vermiculite
   - 1 cup brown rice flour  
   - 1 cup water
   - Mix until fully combined

2. Fill jars:
   - Fill to 1/2 inch from top
   - Wipe rims clean
   - Add 1/2 inch dry vermiculite barrier
   - Cover with foil (shiny side down)

**Step 2: Sterilization**
1. Place jars in pressure cooker with 3 inches water
2. Steam at 15 PSI for 90 minutes
3. OR steam in large pot for 90-120 minutes (less reliable)
4. Let cool completely (12-24 hours minimum)

**Step 3: Inoculation**
1. Work in front of alcohol lamp or in SAB
2. Flame sterilize needle until red hot
3. Let cool 10 seconds
4. Inject 0.25-0.5cc per inoculation point
5. Use 4 inoculation points per jar
6. Cover holes with micropore tape
7. Label jars with date and strain

**Step 4: Colonization**
1. Store at 75-80°F in dark location
2. Check daily for contamination
3. Look for white mycelial growth starting from injection points
4. Expect full colonization in 2-4 weeks
5. Wait 1 week after full colonization (consolidation)

**Signs of Success**:
- Solid white mycelium throughout
- Sweet/earthy mushroom smell
- No discoloration

**Red Flags**:
- Green, black, pink, or orange growth = contamination
- Sour or foul smell = bacterial contamination
- No growth after 2 weeks = temperature too low or dead spores

**Step 5: Birthing Cakes**
1. Remove foil and dry vermiculite layer
2. Tap jar upside down to release cake
3. Rinse cake gently under tap water
4. Submerge in cold water for 12-24 hours (dunk)
5. Remove and drain excess water
6. Roll cake in dry vermiculite (increases surface area)

**Step 6: Fruiting Chamber (SGFC)**
1. Use clear plastic storage tote (50-60qt)
2. Drill 1/4 inch holes every 2 inches on all sides, top, and bottom
3. Add 4-5 inches of wet perlite in bottom
4. Place cakes on squares of foil on top of perlite
5. Position in indirect light (12 hours/day)

**Step 7: Fruiting Conditions**
1. Mist walls of chamber (not directly on cakes) 4-5x daily
2. Fan with lid for 30 seconds 4-5x daily
3. Maintain temperature 72-76°F
4. Expect pins in 5-10 days
5. Harvest when veil breaks (before spores drop)

**Harvesting**:
- Twist and pull at base
- Harvest entire flush at once
- Dunk cakes again for second flush
- Expect 2-4 flushes total

**Common Issues**:
- Side/bottom pins: Poor surface conditions, use liner next time
- Aborts: Low humidity, increase misting
- Fuzzy feet: Insufficient FAE, increase fanning
- No pins: Needs trigger, try cold shock (55°F for 12 hours)

2. Keep sealed completely (no peeking!)
3. Wait 7-14 days for surface colonization
4. Look for:
   - Solid white mycelium on surface
   - Visible through sides of tub
   - Possible metabolite (yellow) pooling
   - Hyphal knots forming

**Step 6: Introduce Fruiting Conditions**
1. Once surface 80-100% colonized:
   - Flip lid upside down (for FAE gap)
   - OR remove tape from holes
   - OR add polyfill to holes
2. Introduce 12-hour light cycle
3. Drop temperature to 72-76°F
4. Begin misting lightly if surface looks dry
5. Fan 2-3x daily

**Step 7: Pinning & Fruiting**
1. Pins form in 5-14 days
2. Maintain tiny water droplets on surface
3. Avoid over-misting (pools of water)
4. Increase FAE as fruits grow
5. Harvest when veil breaks

**Step 8: Multiple Flushes**
1. After harvest, pick all pins and aborts
2. Soak substrate:
   - Submerge entire tub in water
   - Weight down with plates
   - Soak 12-24 hours
3. Drain excess water
4. Return to fruiting conditions
5. Expect 2-4 flushes total, diminishing yields

**Common Issues**:
- Overlay: Too much CO2 during colonization, needs FAE
- Blobs: Genetic mutation, still edible
- Metabolites: Fighting contamination, monitor closely
- Stalled pinning: Needs trigger (cold shock, case layer)

#### Agar Work
**Best for**: Advanced growers, genetic isolation

- Seal immediately

From tissue sample:
- Flame sterilize scalpel
- Cut small piece (rice grain size) from inside of mushroom
- Place on agar plate
- Seal immediately

From existing agar:
- Transfer small wedge to new plate
- Use transfer to isolate fastest/strongest growth

**Step 4: Incubation**
1. Store at 75-78°F
2. Check daily for growth
3. Look for:
   - Clean white mycelium = good
   - Bacterial slime = contamination
   - Green/black spots = mold contamination

**Step 5: Isolation**
1. Mycelium grows in rhizomorphic (stringy) or tomentose (fluffy) patterns
2. Rhizomorphic = more aggressive, preferred
3. Transfer cleanest sector to new plate
4. Repeat 3-5 times for pure culture
5. Use for grain spawn inoculation

**Uses**:
- Create liquid culture from clean plate
- Store genetics long-term (slants in fridge)
- Test spore viability before bulk grows
- Clone exceptional specimens

#### Liquid Culture
**Best for**: Scaling up, fast colonization
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced
**Yield**: Can inoculate 100+ jars from one syringe
**Time**: 1-2 weeks to prepare

**Advantages**:

### 3. SUBSTRATE SCIENCE

#### Substrate Types & Uses

**BRF (Brown Rice Flour)**
- Use: PF Tek cakes
- Nutrients: Complete amino acids, vitamins
- Colonization speed: Medium
- Cost: Medium
- Shelf stability: Good (1 year sealed)
- Notes: Fine powder, easy to work with

**Coco Coir**
- Use: Bulk substrate base
- Nutrients: Low (but great water retention)
- Colonization speed: Fast
- Cost: Very low
- Contam resistance: Excellent
- Notes: Needs pasteurization, not sterilization

**Vermiculite**
- Use: Water retention, aeration
- Nutrients: None (inert)
- Purpose: Holds moisture, provides air pockets
- Cost: Low
- Notes: Use medium or coarse grade

**Manure (Composted)**
- Use: Bulk substrate for P. cubensis
- Nutrients: High
- Colonization speed: Fast
- Contam risk: Higher
- Cost: Low
- Notes: Must be fully composted, pasteurized

**Straw**
- Use: Oyster mushrooms, other gourmets
- Nutrients: Low-medium
- Colonization speed: Very fast
- Cost: Very low
- Prep: Requires pasteurization or cold fermentation
- Notes: Great for beginners with oysters

**Hardwood Sawdust**
- Use: Lion's mane, shiitake, reishi
- Nutrients: Medium
- Colonization speed: Medium-slow
- Supplements: Often needs bran addition (10-20%)
- Cost: Low (free from sawmills)
- Notes: Species-specific (use oak, maple, avoid pine/cedar)

**Coffee Grounds**
- Use: Oyster mushrooms
- Nutrients: High nitrogen
- Colonization speed: Very fast
- Contam risk: Very high
- Cost: Free
- Notes: Must use fresh (within 24 hours), pre-sterilized from brewing

**Master's Mix**

- Use: High-yield gourmet substrate
- Nutrients: Very high
- Yields: 150-200% biological efficiency
- Cost: Medium
- Notes: Requires sterilization, very productive

#### Field Capacity
**Critical Concept**: Proper moisture level

**Test**:
1. Squeeze handful of substrate firmly
2. Should release 3-7 drops of water
3. When opened, substrate should hold form
4. Should not drip continuously

**Too Wet**:
- Problems: Anaerobic conditions, bacterial growth
- Fix: Add dry substrate, improve drainage

**Too Dry**:
- Problems: Slow colonization, low yields
- Fix: Mist substrate, add water to mix

**Measurement**:
- Ideal: 60-65% moisture content by weight
- Use gram scale for precision

#### Pasteurization vs Sterilization

**Pasteurization** (160-180°F for 1-2 hours):
- Use for: Low-nutrient substrates (coir, straw)
- Kills: Most competitors, leaves beneficial bacteria
- Method: Bucket tek, hot water bath
- Cost: Very low
- Risk: Low

**Sterilization** (250°F at 15 PSI for 90-120 min):
- Use for: High-nutrient substrates (grain, supplemented sawdust)
- Kills: Everything including beneficial organisms
- Method: Pressure cooker only
- Cost: Higher (equipment, time)
- Risk: Higher (any contamination spreads rapidly)

**Why the difference?**:
- Coir has little nutrition, few competitors can survive
- Grain has high nutrition, ANY contaminant will thrive
- Pasteurization is faster and cheaper when viable

### 4. ENVIRONMENTAL MASTERY

#### Temperature Control

**Colonization Phase**:
- Optimal: 75-80°F for most species
- Too cold (<70°F): Slow growth, stalling
- Too hot (>85°F): Stress, contamination risk
- Monitoring: Digital thermometer min/max

**Fruiting Phase**:
- Optimal: 72-76°F for most species
- Species variations:
  - Oysters: 55-75°F (cooler)
  - Shiitake: 55-65°F (cold shock helpful)
  - Reishi: 70-80°F (warmer)

**Temperature Drop Trigger**:
- 5-10°F drop signals fruiting time
- Mimics seasonal change in nature
- Not always necessary but helpful

**Heating Solutions**:
- Seedling heat mats (cheap, effective)
- Space heaters with thermostats
- Reptile heat cable
- Insulated chambers

**Cooling Solutions**:
- Air conditioning (expensive)
- Evaporative cooling (perlite moisture)
- Basement growing (naturally cool)
- Fans for air movement

#### Humidity Control

**Why It Matters**:
- Mushroom fruits are 90% water
- Need high humidity to maintain turgidity
- Low humidity = aborts, small fruits
- Too high humidity = bacterial issues

**Measuring**:
- Hygrometer (digital preferred)
- Target: 85-95% during fruiting
- Lower OK during colonization

**Increasing Humidity**:
- Misting walls (not directly on mushrooms)
- Wet perlite in chamber
- Ultrasonic humidifier
- Wet towels
- More frequent misting

**Decreasing Humidity**:
- Increase FAE
- Remove water sources
- Add dehumidifier
- Improve ventilation

**Automation**:
- Humidity controller + humidifier
- Set target range (90-95%)
- Plug-and-play solution
- Cost: $50-100

#### Fresh Air Exchange (FAE)

**Why It Matters**:
- Mushrooms respire, consume O2, produce CO2
- High CO2 = fuzzy feet, stunted growth, weird shapes
- Need constant fresh air supply

**Signs of Poor FAE**:
- Fuzzy white mycelium at stem bases (fuzzy feet)
- Elongated, thin stems
- Small caps
- Reaching/stretching growth

**Passive FAE**:
- Holes with polyfill stuffing
- Filtered air exchange
- Works for smaller grows

**Active FAE**:
- Small fans on timers
- Exhaust fans in martha tents
- Computer fans in tubs
- More control, better results

**Balance**:
- FAE competes with humidity
- More FAE = more moisture loss
- Need balance: fresh air + moisture

#### Lighting

**Mushrooms and Light**:
- Don't use light for energy (not photosynthetic)
- Use light for direction (phototropism)
- 12-hour light cycle sufficient
- Indirect light preferred

**Light Sources**:
- Natural indirect sunlight (near window)
- LED shop lights (cheap, cool)
- CFL bulbs
- Even ambient room light works

**Avoid**:
- Direct sunlight (too hot)
- Heat-producing lights (defeats temp control)
- Total darkness (mushrooms reach randomly)

**Photoperiod**:
- 12 hours on, 12 hours off
- Timer for consistency
- Some growers use 24-hour light (works but wastes energy)

- Sweet/earthy smell
- Spreads from inoculation points
- Growth rate: steady, predictable

**Contamination Characteristics**:
- Any color other than white/blue
- Irregular patterns
- Musty, sour, or foul smell
- Often starts from moisture/damage
- Growth rate: often very fast or very slow

## GROWTH PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS

### Problem: Slow/No Colonization

**Symptom Tree**:

IF slow AND temperature normal (75-80°F)
→ Check: Spore/culture viability
→ Check: Grain moisture (too dry?)
→ Check: Genetic strength
→ Solution: Wait longer, test on agar, use LC

IF slow AND temperature low (<70°F)
→ Solution: Add heat source, insulation
→ Expect: Colonization to resume at proper temp

IF no growth AND been 3+ weeks
→ Check: Contamination present?
→ Check: Injection technique (enough solution?)
→ Solution: Likely restart needed

**Risk Assessment**: 🟡 MODERATE
**Timeline**: Add 1-2 weeks to expected time
**Intervention**: Temperature adjustment usually works

### Problem: Stalled Pinning

**Symptom Tree**:

IF fully colonized BUT no pins after 2 weeks
→ Check: FAE sufficient?
→ Check: Light introduced?
→ Check: Temperature dropped 5°F?
→ Solution: Increase triggers

IF pins started BUT stopped/aborted
→ Check: Humidity (should be 90-95%)
→ Check: Direct misting (can cause aborts)
→ Solution: Humidity control, gentler misting

IF primordia (tiny bumps) BUT not developing
→ Check: CO2 levels (need more FAE)
→ Check: Temperature (may need slight drop)
→ Solution: Increase air exchange

**Risk Assessment**: 🟢 LOW - usually environmental
**Timeline**: 3-7 days after adjustments
**Intervention**: Environmental tweaks

### Problem: Aborts (Dark, Stunted Pins)

**Cause Matrix**:

**IF many aborts AND fuzzy feet present**
→ Root Cause: Insufficient FAE
→ Evidence: CO2 buildup
→ Fix: Increase fanning, add holes, fan speed
→ Prevention: Better FAE from start

**IF many aborts AND low humidity readings**
→ Root Cause: Humidity drops
→ Evidence: Hygrometer <85%
→ Fix: Increase misting, add humidifier
→ Prevention: Maintain 90-95% consistently

**IF many aborts AND first flush**
→ Root Cause: Genetic tendency
→ Evidence: Certain strains (PE) do this
→ Fix: Harvest aborts (still good!)
→ Prevention: Choose different genetics

**IF many aborts AND subsequent flushes**
→ Root Cause: Exhausted substrate
→ Evidence: Previous flushes were good
→ Fix: Soak substrate, accept lower yields
→ Prevention: None (natural decline)

**Risk Assessment**: 🟢 LOW - aborts are usable
**Timeline**: Immediate harvest of aborts
**Intervention**: Fix for next flush

### Problem: Contamination Post-Colonization

**Scenario**: Tub was clean, now shows contamination

**Investigation Path**:

1. **Timeline Check**:
   - Contamination in colonization phase = sterilization issue
   - Contamination in fruiting phase = environmental issue

2. **Location Analysis**:
   - Surface only = introduced during opening
   - Deep in substrate = was there during spawn
   - Edges/corners = too much moisture

3. **Type Identification**:
   - Green mold = often moisture + contaminated air
   - Bacterial = over-misting or pooling water

**Action Matrix**:

IF contamination is small (<2 inches) AND surface only
→ Action: Attempt removal (cut out + 2 inches)
→ Spray: 70% isopropyl or H2O2
→ Monitor: Check daily
→ Risk: 🟡 50/50 success rate

IF contamination is spreading (>2 inches) OR deep
→ Action: Remove from grow area immediately
→ Seal: In bag
→ Discard: Outside only
→ Risk: 🔴 Unrecoverable

IF contamination appears after harvest
→ Action: Complete the flush, then discard
→ Risk: 🟡 Safe to harvest if contamination not touching fruits

### Problem: Side/Bottom Pinning

**Why It Happens**:
- Microclimate at edges better than surface
- Higher humidity between liner and tub
- Better FAE at edges
- Cooler temps at edges

**Solutions by Stage**:

**IF currently happening**:
→ Immediate: Harvest side pins (edible)
→ Short-term: Improve surface conditions
→ Mist: More on surface
→ Fan: Better surface air exchange

**IF planning next grow**:
→ Prevention: Use liner (black trash bag)
→ Why: Liner shrinks with substrate, eliminates gap
→ Alternative: Better surface conditions from start

**Risk Assessment**: 🟢 LOW - not harmful
**Timeline**: Harvest and continue
**Intervention**: Prevention for next time

### Problem: Fuzzy Feet

**Definitive Cause**: Insufficient oxygen at base

**Visual Confirmation**:
- White, cotton-like growth at stem base
- Mushrooms otherwise healthy
- Often entire flush affected

**Fix Immediate**:
→ Increase FAE dramatically
→ Fan 2-3x more frequently
→ Ensure air reaches surface level
→ Lower humidity slightly if needed

**Fix Long-term**:
→ Add more/bigger holes in chamber
→ Use active fans on timers
→ Elevate substrate for better airflow underneath

**Harvest Note**: Fuzzy feet doesn't affect quality
→ Just trim off fuzzy part before drying
→ Otherwise perfectly fine

**Risk Assessment**: 🟢 LOW - cosmetic only
**Timeline**: Next flush should be better
**Intervention**: FAE improvement

### Problem: Overlay (Thick White Surface)

**What It Is**:
- Thick, tough mycelium layer on surface
- Prevents pinning
- Caused by too much CO2 during colonization

**Identification**:
- Surface looks "bruised" blue
- Very thick mycelium mat
- 2+ weeks colonized, no pins

**Solutions**:

**IF overlay is present**:
→ Fork Tek: Gently scratch surface with fork
→ Depth: Just surface, not deep
→ Pattern: Cover entire surface
→ Why: Breaks barrier, signals damage = fruit
→ Timeline: Pins in 3-7 days

**IF preventing for next grow**:
→ Introduce FAE earlier (at 50-70% colonization)
→ Don't seal completely during colonization
→ Use unmodified tub method

**Risk Assessment**: 🟡 MODERATE - delays fruiting
**Timeline**: 5-10 days after fork tek
**Intervention**: Fork tek usually works
